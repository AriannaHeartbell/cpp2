List

1) Capsule

- friend.cpp: Psycho-Pass


2) Polymorphism: for STL

- operator overloding.cpp: vector operation (+, -, inner product) in R^2
- template: stack
- STL_vector&iterator: load file and make vector and reverse the order and save in new file.
   char : it makes one more push.
   string : not.
   What is different?

3) IO: Memory <-> HDD, SSD

- file_IO: copy(grade) to result
- try catch

4) type
- typecast : 'static' cast(for basic type cast) vs 'dynamic' cast(for for point/reference of class cast)
